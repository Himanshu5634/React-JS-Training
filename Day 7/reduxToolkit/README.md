# Day 7 - Redux Toolkit

## Overview:
Day 7 focuses on implementing state management in React using **Redux Toolkit**. The task involves building a Shopping Cart application with features like adding items, updating quantities, removing items, and calculating the total price. The cart data is persisted in `localStorage` for a consistent user experience.

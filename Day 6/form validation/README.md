# Day 6 - Form Validation

## Overview:
Day 6 focuses on implementing form validation in React using **Regex**. The task involves creating a form with multiple input fields, validating the inputs, and displaying error messages for invalid entries. The form prevents submission until all fields are valid.

## Project: Form Validation

### Description:
This project demonstrates how to validate form inputs in React using **Regex**. It includes real-time validation for fields like email, password, and phone number, ensuring that the data entered by the user meets specific criteria.

   - Validate the email format (e.g., `example@domain.com`).
   - Ensure the password meets specific criteria (e.g., minimum length, special characters, etc.).
   - Validate other fields like phone number, name, etc., based on requirements.

2. **Error Messages**:
   - Display real-time error messages for invalid inputs.
   - Highlight invalid fields to improve user experience.

3. **Form Submission**:
   - Prevent form submission until all fields are valid.
   - Provide feedback to the user when the form is successfully submitted.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Clean and responsive design for the form.
   - Real-time validation feedback for a better user experience.
